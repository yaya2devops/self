## 21 `⦿` before that 22 years old.

My life changed at twenty two, so here is a 21 ⦿ for you.

[![The Divine](whole/public/favicon.svg)](https://dot.h.ya-ya.tech)

This symbol means the world to me.
<br>You'll probably find it everywhere in my works.

You can call it whatever you wish: the self versus the other, the conscious versus the unconscious, the ego versus the whole, or even in metaphysical terms, the Monad or the Absolute.

For me, it represents all of these and more—something that combines them all.

### Our connection to the divine.

We are not separate from the very others.

Sit in the middle and let things flow just around you ⦿

- Here is the emotional center - The feelings ⦿
- Here is the intellectual center - The mind ⦿
- Here is the instictive center - The body ⦿

And here is [the sly man](https://create.ya-ya.tech/sly/man.pdf) ⦿

⦿ + ⦿ + ⦿
